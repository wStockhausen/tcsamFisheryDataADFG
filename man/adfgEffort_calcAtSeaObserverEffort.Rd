\description{
Function to calculate at-sea observer sampling effort from measure pot data.
}
\details{
NOTE: MPD appears not to include sampled pots that DID NOT have Tanner crab.
As a consequence, the observer effort calculated here DOES NOT INCLUDE sampled pots with
no Tanner crab in them. Uses \code{sqldf::sqldf}.
